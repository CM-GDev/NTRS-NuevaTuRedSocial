  ## Description
  
  - The purpose of this homework assignment was to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. 
  - I built the back end from scratch and by completing this assignment, I was able to implement lessons from my course, including:
    - Configured a working Express.js API
    - Used Mongoose ORM to interact with a NoSQL database
    - Utilized the express-session npm package for authentication
    - Followed the MVC paradigm to structure my files.
    - Established Express.js routes to deploy the application
    
    
  The following are screenshots of the application running on my local server and MySQL Databased initiated with data.
