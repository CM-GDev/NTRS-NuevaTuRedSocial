  ## Description
  
  - The purpose of this homework assignment was to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. 
  - I built the back end from scratch and by completing this assignment, I was able to implement lessons from my course, including:
    - Configured a working Express.js API
    - Used Mongoose ODM to interact with a NoSQL database
    - Followed the MVC paradigm to structure my files.
    - Established Express.js routes to deploy the application
  - See the Usage section for a link to a walkthrough video demonstrating the application's functionality using Insomnia
    
    
  The following is a screenshot of all the server routes as seen in Insomnia.
